Hey <%= @designation.first_name %>

Looks like your off on a Summer Project. Before that all happens you'll have the opportunity to do some Ministry Partner Development. Don't worry, we've put together a system to help you through the process. As you receive donations you'll be able to see each donor and how much they've given.

To get started click the link below, sign in with Facebook, then enter your activation code we've given you below (this links your donations with your account).

If you have any questions, please contact the person coaching you through the MPD process.

Your Activation Code is:
